        "## Understanding Dueling DQN vs. Standard DQN\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional Reinforcement Learning, the agent tries to learn the Action-Value function, denoted as $Q(s, a)$. This value represents the expected total reward the agent will receive by taking action $a$ in state $s$. However, in many states, the specific action chosen does not significantly impact the outcome. For example, in a car racing game, whether the car steers slightly left or right while on a straight stretch of road might not change the overall \"value\" of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Standard DQN Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "In a standard Deep Q-Network (DQN), the neural network treats every state-action pair as a unique entity to be learned. The architecture consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features from the game frames.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fully Connected Layers:** Map these features directly to a set of $Q(s, a)$ values—one for every possible move (e.g., steer left, steer right, gas, brake).\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Dueling DQN Innovation\n",
        "\n",
        "The Dueling DQN architecture changes how the network calculates these values by splitting the final layers into two separate streams:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State Value Stream ($V(s)$):** This stream predicts how \"good\" it is to be in a certain state, regardless of which action is taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Advantage Stream ($A(s, a)$):** This stream predicts the relative importance (advantage) of each action compared to the others in that specific state.\n",
        "\n",
        "By separating these two, the agent can learn which states are valuable even if it hasn't explored every single action in those states yet. This makes the learning process much more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Aggregation Layer\n",
        "\n",
        "To get the final Q-values used for decision-making, we combine the two streams using a specific formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Q(s, a) = V(s) + \\left( A(s, a) - \\frac{1}{|A|} \\sum_{a'} A(s, a') \\right)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Why subtract the mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "We subtract the average advantage to \"center\" the values. This ensures that the $V(s)$ stream truly captures the average value of the state, while the $A(s, a)$ stream focuses purely on the differences between actions.Key \n",
        "\n",
        "### Differences between Dueling and normal DQN\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Standard DQN, the agent learns the \"Quality\" of a state-action pair $Q(s, a)$ as a single value. In the Dueling DQN, the network is forced to learn two separate things:\n",
        "\n",
        "- State Value ($V$): How good is it to be in this position?\n",
        "- Advantage ($A$): How much better is \"Steer Left\" compared to \"Steer Right\" in this specific moment?T\n",
        "\n",
        "his separation is particularly effective for racing. For example, when driving at high speeds on a straight stretch of track, the \"Value\" of being on the road is very high, regardless of whether the agent chooses to steer slightly left or right. The Dueling DQN recognizes this redundancy, leading to more stable and efficient training.\n",
